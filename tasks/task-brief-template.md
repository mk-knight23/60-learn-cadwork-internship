## Technical Approach

### Architecture/Design

[Describe your technical approach:

- Key components and their responsibilities
- Data flow and interactions
- Design patterns used
- Tradeoffs considered

**Example**:
We'll use a pipeline pattern with three stages:
1. **Parser**: Extract metadata from CAD files
2. **Validator**: Check against rules engine
3. **Reporter**: Generate validation report

This approach allows us to easily add new validation rules without modifying the core pipeline.]

### Implementation Plan

1. **Step 1**: [Subtask 1 - e.g., "Create parser service"]
   - Estimate: 2 hours
   - Deliverable: [What you'll have at the end]

2. **Step 2**: [Subtask 2 - e.g., "Implement validation rules"]
   - Estimate: 4 hours
   - Deliverable: [What you'll have at the end]

3. **Step 3**: [Subtask 3 - e.g., "Write tests"]
   - Estimate: 2 hours
   - Deliverable: [What you'll have at the end]
